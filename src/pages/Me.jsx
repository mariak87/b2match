                I am a Computer Science student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb.
                I am from Split, but I moved to Zagreb to study. 
                During my academic journey I was interested in application development and data science. 
                I participated in Erasmus+ exchange program at Universidade de Aveiro in Portugal. 
                In my free time I like to play volleyball, read and cook. 
                I made a simple culinary web application for anyone who has a passion for cooking or is just learning to cook.
                I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
